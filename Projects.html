								<p>An online text-based game bot made in C# (Visual studio 2019). It uses the Discord.Net API to run on discord servers where multiple people at once can use it and have fun playing with it's commands. It's an economy based game where users can make money, gamble it, duel each other and more fun and interesting things. The code is available for anyone to see but some parts of it will only work if the path files are set correctly, which they are in my PC, but might not be for someone else. This is a project I still work on from time to time so it might be more advanced in the future.</p>

								<p>Officially titled "Dead Dread V3" due to it being the third version of the program, this fan game was one of my first big projects built in 2018 on the side. It was briefly abandoned due to the visual limitations of the language I used (Visual Basic or VB) which I realized a bit late. Due to this, the game looks and is very buggy in appearance. The artwork used in the game is not owned or created by me thus this game is not public except on LinkedIn for showcasing and to my friends. More information in the project file.</p>
